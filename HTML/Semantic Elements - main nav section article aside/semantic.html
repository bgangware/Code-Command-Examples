        <article>Forever My Girl is a 2018 American romantic drama film written and directed by Bethany Ashton Wolf
            based on the novel by Heidi McLaughlin. It follows a country musician (Alex Roe) who sets out to win over
            the girl he left at the altar eight years before (Jessica Rothe). Abby Ryder Fortson, Travis Tritt, and John
            Benjamin Hickey also star.

            The film was released in the United States on January 19, 2018.[2][3][4] It received negative reviews from
            critics, who denounced the writing and chemistry between the actors, and compared it negatively to Nicholas
            Sparks films.[5] However, audience reception was more positive, and the film was a modest box office success
            grossing $16 million on a $3.5 million budget.</article>
